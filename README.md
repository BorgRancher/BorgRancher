### About Me

- 👋 Hi, I’m @BorgRancher, an ageing rebel with what he imagines approaches a clue. (More like a babbling, bug-eyed druid type who occassionally makes sense, and writes decent enough code on the daily.) Pleased to meet you. 

- 👀 I’m interested in mobile applications (IOS and Android), IOT and AI with a special fascination for Computer Vision and it's many non-dystopian applications. AI is scarily good at very narrow things, my job is to train, select and combine enough narrow skills to make the average human's eyes go wide with wonder.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Jetpack Compose, and actively avoiding React Native - I'm a native Android (Java, Kotlin, C++) / IOS (Objective-C/Swift) dev (that's my most recent pair of hats), and I've never liked typing, so I will contribute whatever I can to make multi-platform development a smooth and simple transition for people who might feel as bewildered as I was at first.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that uses tech to solve real-world problems for ordinary people, no one should live below the API.
